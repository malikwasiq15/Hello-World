# ASSIGNMENT: Find One Real Agentic AI Use Case

# Company Name and the problem faced

**Shopify**

Before AI, Shopify store owners had a hard time helping customers find and buy products. Small teams or single-person shops spent many hours answering questions, managing inventory, and copleting sales. Searching online and buying 	across stores was slow and expensive. Shopify needed a better way for customers to find, ask about, and buy products without changing the 	entire system.

# What the agent does and how humans stay in control?	
**Shopify Sidekick** is an AI healper for online stores. It knows products, prices, atock, and cusomer questions. Sidekick can suggest products, answer questions, update store items, and help customers finish checkout. Store owners stay in control. They decide whether to use Sidekick,set prices, and manage inventory. They can review, change, or stop anything the AI suggests. If something gose wrong, the AI can be turned off.

# What measurable results they got?
+ Since January, Shopify reported that AI traffic to stores increased 7 times and AI-attributed orders increased 11 times. Some merchants, like Alexander Del Rossa, saw up to 3 times more sales when using AI Brand Agents. These results show AI can help stores sell more and reach more customers.

# Why this matters?
+ AI makes shopping faster and easier. It matches shoppers with the right products, add items to cart, and helps complete checkout. Small store teams save times and reduce mistakes. This method works for many stores and marketplaces, not just Shopify.
